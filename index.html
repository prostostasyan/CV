            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Hello! My name is Stanislav. I want to become a Frontend developer.</p>
                <p>From 2014 to 2021 I worked as an engineer in the field of telecommunications technology. While in
                    this position, I was interested in the following: microwave measurements; control of parameters of
                    radio
                    engineering and telecommunication systems; spectrometric signal processing. I had experience in
                    programming in C/C++. In addition, I worked in such mathematical software packages MatLab and Mathcad.
                    In addition, from 2016 to 2020, I was engaged in teaching activities in the following subjects:
                    "Digital
                    Signal Processing", "Digital Television", "Signals and Processes in Telecommunication Systems".
                </p>
                <p>Three years ago I started to get involved in web development purely out of interest. At first, I
                    mastered
                    Back-end development using PHP at a basic level, then I began to study front-end development in
                    parallel
                    and realized that this is exactly the direction where I want to develop.</p>

            </ul>

            <div>
                <p>I started my journey by studying HTML and CSS. As a source of information, I used
                    video tutorials from YouTube, as well as many Internet sites, in particular (<a
                            href="http://code.mu" target="_blank">https://code.mu</a>), I
                    also
                    took assignments from there. My first application was the game "Cities", written using the PHP
                    language. A randomizer was chosen as a rival, with the help of which the names of non-repeating
                    cities were pulled from the database, for this I had to study MySQL in more depth. However, the
                    application didn't look very presentable and it lacked functionality and I realized that I needed
                    to additionally know JavaScript (JS) well. </p>
                <p>It was always easier for me to learn something by do[ing, and I started learning JS by creating a
                    simple Сalculator. In the course of creating the Calculator, I discovered that I didn't have enough
                    knowledge and skills in order to cope with the task, so it was decided to take a
                    basic paid course <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru/courses" target="_blank">HTML Academy</a>.
                    In parallel with taking the courses, I studied the
                    basics of JS using the tutorial <a href="https://learn.javascript.ru" target="_blank">https://learn.javascript.ru</a>.
                </p>
                <p>After passing HTML Academy, I studied layout well, I also got experience using Sass, after which I
                    started developing my Calculator (https://github.com/prostostasyan/-Calculator), in the process of
                    creating an application I learned well DOM operations using JS. Then I started developing standard
                    practical mini-games in JS, such as
                    "15 puzzle" (<a href="https://github.com/prostostasyan/Simple-puzzle" target="_blank">https://github.com/prostostasyan/Simple-puzzle</a>),
                    "Find The Pairs"
                    (https://github.com/prostostasyan/Memory -game), where was necessary find and match all pairs of
                    pictures,
                    in this game combinations of pictures and their
                    arrangement were created randomly.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <main>
        <div class="proSkillsBlock">
            <div>
                <p>After that I made a movie search site (<a
                        href="https://github.com/prostostasyan/MovieSearch-with-API-" target="_blank">https://github.com/prostostasyan/MovieSearch-with-API-</a>)
                    based on the API (<a href="https://api.themoviedb.org"
                                         target="_blank">https://api.themoviedb.org</a>), during development I gained
                    experience using Promise,
                    in particular, I learned how to send requests and handle responses with Fetch. Next, I started
                    exploring the React JavaScript library. I studied courses on YouTube
                    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8</a>),
                    while transferring my
                    old projects to the new technology. The learning outcomes are stored in the Git repository
                    https://github.com/prostostasyan/React-demo. During the course, I understood what class and
                    functional components are and how to create them, understood what lifecycle methods are for, how and
                    where to use them, studied and learned how to use React-Hooks, studied React-Redux.</p>

                <p>Then I created an application (<a href="https://github.com/prostostasyan/fakeGismeteo"
                                                     target="_blank">https://github.com/prostostasyan/fakeGismeteo</a>),
                    which showed the
                    weather forecast through the API (<a href="http://api.openweathermap.org" target="_blank">http://api.openweathermap.org</a>),
                    in which I first used the
                    Styled-components library, and also connected a map to the application, on which the current
                    location of the requested city is determined.</p>

                <p>To consolidate my knowledge React-Redux I created an application "To Do List".
                    The application marks the list of completed tasks, in addition, I used a server part based on fake
                    REST API <a href="https://github.com/typicode/json-server" target="_blank">json-server.</a></p>
